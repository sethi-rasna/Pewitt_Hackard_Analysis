# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis

We reviewed Pewitt Hackard's employee database to see not only how many employees were of retirement age but also to see about a succession plan with the current employee base. We need to see if we have enough employees to cover all of the retiring talent. 

## Results

Here are the main conclusions we discovered throughout our analysis:
- Of those retiring, the majority of positions were senior roles, particularly senior engineers and senior staff. 
- There are only j1700 employees eligible for the mentorship program while there are over 30000 that are of retirement age. 
- It seems as though there is a gap between senior level staff and staff right below senior level staff.
- There is a serious need for either hiring more senior staff or promoting more staff from within into senior positions because the retiring cohort is currently larger than those we deemed eligible for mentorship. This is on the same trend as a population because those set to retire are of a larger population than those currently in the workforce.

## Summary
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  - Over 30,000 roles will need to be filled once the silver tsunami takes complete effect.
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation fo Pewlett Hackard employees?
  - There are enough retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees but we worry that there is a gap in the number of employees eligible for mentorship vs. the number of employees getting set to retire.
